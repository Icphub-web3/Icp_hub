A decentralized hub for project collaboration, governance, and identity on the Internet Computer — built for the World Computer Hacker League (WCHL) Hackathon.

## 🚀 Overview

**ICPHub DAO** is a modular, Web3-native project management and participation framework. It integrates wallet-based identity (via WalletConnect & Web3Modal), community governance, decentralized storage, and energy data insights.

It serves as the DAO frontend for projects like **HeliosHash**, supporting transparent RWA (Real World Assets) management, contributor onboarding, and public dashboards — all on-chain and censorship-resistant.
